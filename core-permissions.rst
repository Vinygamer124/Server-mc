Implied permissions
-------------------

Some permissions automatically grant (or deny) other permissions by default when granted. These are referred to as **implied permissions**.

Permissions may imply permissions which in turn imply other permissions (e.g. ``pocketmine.group.operator`` implies ``pocketmine.group.user``, which in turn implies ``pocketmine.command.help``).

Implied permissions can be overridden by explicit permissions from elsewhere.

**Note:** When explicitly denied, implied permissions are inverted. This means that "granted" becomes "denied" and vice versa.
